# [◆](/../../) ❱ Adding or transferring rank

[![Confirm alt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-Confirm_Alt-important?style=for-the-badge)](/Other/ConfirmAlt.md)

You may want to add rank to a User or transfer rank from one User to another. Rank transfers are done upon request to an Alpha.

If you are transferring rank from a User that is pending kick, please do not kick the User until the rank transfer is complete.

At this time, **WE DO NOT ADD RANK** without transferring from another User.

## Transferring rank

After verifying the Alt, please provide an Alpha with the following information:

- User UID
- Alt UID

Given this information, Alphas will be able to transfer rank from User to Alt.

_Note: If User has been kicked, Alphas can still retrieve the rank data, but it will take longer._
